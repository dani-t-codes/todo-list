- Ensure Homebrew packages are run with this line of code: `echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile`.
- Once homebrew is installed, install Git, a version control system for code writers, with this line of code `brew install git`.

###### For Windows Users

- Open a new Command Prompt window by typing "Cmd" in your computer's search bar.
- Determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows by following these (instructions)[https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running].

- Follow the instructions in the set up menu.

#### For Both Mac & Windows systems

- Once you have Git installed on your computer, go to this (GitHub repository)[https://github.com/dani-t-codes/todo-list], click the "Fork" button in the upper right hand corner of the page, and clone this application with the following command:`git clone https://github.com/dani-t-codes/todo-list.git`.


#### Installing C#, .NET, dotnet script, & MySQL

* Install C# and .Net according to your operating system below. 

###### For Mac

* Open the .pkg file. This will launch an installer which will walk you through installation steps. Use the default settings the installer suggests.
* Confirm the installation is successful by opening your terminal and running the command $ dotnet --version, which should return something like: `2.2.105`. 

###### For Windows (10+)
* Download either the the 64-bit .NET Core SDK (Software Development Kit)[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.2.203-windows-x64-installer]. Clicking these links will prompt a .exe file download from Microsoft.
* Open the file and follow the steps provided by the installer for your OS.

#### For Mac & Windows Operating Systems
* Install dotnet script with the following terminal command `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-script`.

#### Opening the Project on your Local System
Once the project has been cloned to your computer and you have all the necessary items on your local computer, open the project in the application of your choice ((Visual Code Studio)[https://code.visualstudio.com/] was used and is recommended by the application builder), and run the following...

* Navigate to the project folder on your Terminal or CMD.
* `dotnet build` will get bin/ and obj/ folders downloaded.
